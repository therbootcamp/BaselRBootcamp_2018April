1
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:04,423
A girl will return to the docks.

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:06,089
She will watch
the gambler.

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,214
And then what?

4
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:09,538
A gift for the thin man.

5
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,061
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

6
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,974
You have no one at your side who
understands the land you want to rule.

7
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:16,517
What would you
have me do with him?

8
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,672
A ruler who kills
those devoted to her

9
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:20,823
is not a ruler
who inspires devotion.

10
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,742
Remove Ser Jorah
from the city.

11
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:26,324
You said whoever wins will fight
at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

12
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:27,797
Let me fight for her.

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,636
The Iron Bank has called
in the crown's debts.

14
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,996
We must send an envoy
to show these bankers our respect.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,023
Ser Meryn will
lead your escort.

16
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,977
There are only two
like it in the world.

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,861
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

18
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:45,178
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

19
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:46,811
Dorne's too dangerous
for you.

20
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:47,878
I've come to take you home.

21
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,242
I love Trystane,
I'm going to marry him,

22
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,876
and we're staying
right here.

23
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:54,337
This is about
survival.

24
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,136
<i>The Night's Watch will let you</i>
<i>through the tunnel.</i>

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,104
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

26
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,709
The white walkers don't care.

27
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,929
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

28
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:05,882
But together
we can beat them.

29
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,404
We still have a hard march
to Winterfell

30
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,412
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

31
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:18,534
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

32
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,913
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

33
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:23,482
Because if I don't,
we've lost.

34
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:26,133
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

35
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,879
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,317
We are more prepared
for a siege than they could ever be.

37
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:34,341
The snow is so deep,

38
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:36,180
we couldn't get
an army through to engage them

39
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,480
even if we wanted to.

40
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:38,703
I don't need an army.

41
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:40,679
I need 20 good men.

42

<i>- Look out!</i>
<i>- Fire! Fire!</i>

48
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,881
A band of 20 men,
maybe less.

49
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,133
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

50
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,085
Burnt our food stores
to the ground,

51
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,337
all our siege weapons
destroyed.

52
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,723
- Dozens of tents were--
- Horses?

53
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,892
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

54
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:59,596
20 men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

55
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,182
The northerners know
more about their land than we ever will.

56
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:03,817
Put last night's guards
in chains.

57
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,518
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with the enemy.

58
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,441
Find out the truth
and then hang them.

59
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:09,065
Your Grace.

60
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,408
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press forward to Winterfell

61
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,028
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,913
We're not returning
to Castle Black.

63
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:17,814
Forgive me, Your Grace,

64
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:20,028
I never claimed to be an expert
in military matters,

65
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,953
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

66
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:39,886
Have the dead horses
butchered for meat.

67
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,762
<i>Halt!</i>

68
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:25,682
<i> Halt!</i>

69
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,904
<i> There it is!</i>

70
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,729
Open the gates.

71
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,747
It was a failure.

72
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,549
It wasn't.

73
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,802
I went to save them.
I failed.

74
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,639
You didn't fail him.

75
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,007
Or him.

76
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,843
<i>Or her.</i>

77
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:47,347
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

78
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,317
I don't think
that fact's lost on them.

79
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:48,658
You have a good heart,
Jon Snow.

80
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,160
It'll get us all killed.

81
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,135
Out of my way.

82
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,779
You sent for me,
Your Grace?

83
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:29,032
Find some healthy horses and
a few knights to guard you.

84
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:31,084
I'm sending you back
to Castle Black.

85
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,336
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

86
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,755
to send food, supplies,
fresh horses.

87
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,540
In return,
when I take the throne,

88
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:40,593
I'll make sure the Night's Watch has
all the men it requires.

89
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:43,930
He can guard all 19 castles
on the Wall if he so wishes.

90
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:49,218
Your Grace,
you named me your Hand.

91
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,803
Yes.

92
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,805
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

93
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,273
especially
in time of war.

94
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,142
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

95
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:58,561
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

96
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,147
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

97
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:03,399
what does the boy say?

98
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,618
I didn't name you Hand for your expertise
in military matters.

99
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:08,154
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

100
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,913
Your Grace,
perhaps Queen Selyse

101
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,831
and Princess Shireen
could accompany me.

102
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:20,917
My family stays with me.

103
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,002
At least let me
take Shireen.

104
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,555
<i>A siege is no place</i>
<i>for a little girl.</i>

105
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,974
My family stays with me.

106
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:05,378
What's this one now?

107
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,763
"The Dance of Dragons:
A True Telling"

108
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,215
by Grand Maester Munkun.

109
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,602
Now that sounds
like a proper story.

110
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,271
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

111
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:18,274
He polished his shield
for a week so that it was like a mirror.

112
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,359
And he crouched behind it
and crept forward,

113
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,435
hoping the dragon would
only see its own reflection.

114
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,565
But the dragon saw
a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.

115
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,233
And burnt him
to a crisp.

116
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,870
Thus ending
the dragon-slaying career

117
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:33,739
of Ser Byron Swann.

118
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,327
I made you something,
Princess.

119
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,219
Do you like it?

120
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:48,137
He's beautiful.

121
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:50,890
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

122
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:53,426
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

123
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,311
Of course I will.

124
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,397
But why am I
getting a present?

125
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,484
Because you deserve it.

126
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:06,656
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

127
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,025
Gods, I was stubborn
about it.

128
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,994
Made it this far
without reading.

129
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,530
Seemed to me I could
make it to the grave.

130
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:18,784
Wish I'd listened to him.

131
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,622
This is my own poor way
of saying thank you.

132
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,377
For teaching me
to be a grown-up.

133
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,849
I'll be gone for a few days,
Princess.

134
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:36,552
I want to hear all about
"The Dance of Dragons" when I'm back.

135
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:38,854
You'll read it yourself.

136
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:01,827
Prince Doran.

137
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,413
Forgive us.
We started without you.

138
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,166
<i>Please, sit.</i>

139
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:09,719
Princess Myrcella.

140
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,387
Uncle.

141
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:13,272
What a lovely dress.

142
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,608
- You don't like it?
- You must be cold.

143
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:19,278
Not at all.
The Dornish climate agrees with me.

144
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:23,149
Prince Trystane.

145
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:26,485
How's your jaw?

146
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,322
A fleabite.

147
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:30,940
What are you
doing in Dorne?

148
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:33,242
Looking after the safety of my niece,
the Princess Myrcella.

149
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,612
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

150
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,998
you decided to enter
my country in secret

151
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,666
and abduct our guest
by force?

152
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,919
We received
a threatening message.

153
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:47,173
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

154
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,509
That necklace
was stolen from my room.

155
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:59,268
Oh, excellent.

156
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,520
A last meal before
the beheading?

157
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,105
Oh, I can't behead you.

158
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,558
Many in Dorne want war.

159
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,560
But I've seen war.

160
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:10,363
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

161
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:13,899
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

162
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,985
I don't want to lead
my people into that hell.

163
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,738
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

164
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,374
And that is precisely
what we are doing.

165
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:26,796
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

166
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,332
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

167
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,550
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

168
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,404
King Tommen insists

169
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:54,407
on his sister's return
to the capital?

170
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,575
I'm afraid he does.

171
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,697
I cannot disobey
my king's command.

172
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,200
She will return with you
to King's Landing.

173
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,670
<i>And my son Prince Trystane</i>
<i>will accompany you both.</i>

174
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:11,340
If the alliance between
the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,

175
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,842
their engagement
must stand.

176
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:14,960
I accept.

177
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,680
One more thing.
My brother was named

178
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,383
to the small council
before his death.

179
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:22,351
Your father understood
the importance

180
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,220
<i>of keeping Dorne</i>
<i>in the fold.</i>

181
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:28,808
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take
his place on the small council.

182
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:29,975
You have my word.

183
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,528
The word
of a kingslayer.

184
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:39,068
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

185
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,370
You are mother
to four of my nieces,

186
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,155
girls I love very much.

187
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,991
For their sake, I hope you live
a long and happy life.

188
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,544
Speak to me that way again,
and you won't.

189
00:15:56,337 --> 00:16:00,005
May I inquire as to the fate
of my man Bronn?

190
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:03,175
Tell me, Ser Jaime,
in King's Landing,

191
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:06,479
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

192
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,063
He said it was
just a fleabite.

193
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,234
The fault is mine.

194
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,520
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

195
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:18,107
If anyone should
be punished, it's me.

196
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,026
Prince Trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

197
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,778
I'll let him decide.

198
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:30,202
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

199
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:33,672
-<i> I'll set your man free.</i>
- You're a good man.

200
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,542
On one condition.

201
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,602
Why do we play?
I'm better than you.

202
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:48,971
I'll always
be better than you.

203
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:51,857
Have I ever missed once?

204
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,777
I don't think I have.
I can't recall.

205
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:57,396
You must love humiliation.
Or pain.

206
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,116
Which do you love most,
humiliation or pain?

207
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:04,069
That one hurt,
didn't it?

208
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:07,072
You going to cry?

209
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:09,041
Give up, little sister.

210
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,126
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

211
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,463
You will.
You're thinking too much.

212
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:17,550
Now you're nervous.
What if she's right?

213
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,756
- Luck.
- Now it's my turn.

214
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,424
You're too slow.

215
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,309
You've always been
too slow.

216
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:45,911
Am I gonna be happy
at the end of this walk?

217
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,997
You'll find out
very soon.

218
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,751
Say it one more time,
handsome.

219
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,203
Who am I?

220
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,123
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

221
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,542
And that's the truth.

222
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:02,211
- Slut.

223
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:04,213
Prince Doran,

224
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:07,299
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

225
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,702
I didn't realize there were
knights of the Blackwater.

226
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,337
Only the one.

227
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:13,906
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

228
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,141
Prince.

229
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,893
Sorry about
the other day.

230
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:20,396
<i>Prince Trystane here</i>
<i>is a man of mercy.</i>

231
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,781
He's agreed to grant
you your freedom.

232
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,485
I'm glad to hear it.

233
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,321
Pie looks good.

234
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,957
There was one condition.

235
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,385
Perhaps some soup
instead.

236
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:48,757
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

237
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,729
Oysters, clams,
and cockles.

238
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:57,600
Oysters, clams,
and cockles.

239
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:59,852
Oysters, clams,
and cock--

240
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,520
How much
for your little clam?

241
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:13,032
Oysters, clams,
and cockles.

242
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,954
Oysters, clams,
and cockles.

243
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,867
Come on.

244
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,906
<i>Some oysters, girl!</i>

245
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,625
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

246
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,994
Is, uh...

247
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:02,331
- Girl!
<i>-  Tie her up!</i>

248
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:05,751
<i>Are you deaf?</i>
<i>Girl!</i>

249
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:08,754
Girl!

250
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:15,594
My lord.

251
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,183
<i>My lord.</i>

252
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:22,985
<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>

253
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,570
On behalf
of the Iron Bank,

254
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,522
may I be the first
to welcome you

255
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:28,273
to the Free City
of Braavos.

256
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:30,275
I hope your journey
was trouble-free.

257
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,027
A bit of chop
the last few days.

258
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,163
Nothing too awful.

259
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,615
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

260
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,951
And how goes
the harvest in the Reach?

261
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,370
Ah, the vintners say
this might be

262
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:44,623
the best year for red grapes
in half a century.

263
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,710
<i>If we come to a satisfactory</i>
<i>arrangement,</i>

264
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:52,631
I'll be sure to send
a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.

265
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:55,267
I'm afraid
I don't partake.

266
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,302
Oh.

267
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:07,029
Some consider
usury distasteful, dishonorable.

268
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:08,697
Pure nonsense,
of course.

269
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,033
I'm glad we see
eye to eye on this matter.

270
00:21:11,068 --> 00:21:13,485
<i>Did you know that at one</i>
<i>point Maegor the third</i>

271
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,321
tried to outlaw it
in the Seven Kingdoms?

272
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,490
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

273
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:21,210
<i>and cut off</i>
<i>both their hands.</i>

274
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,328
Most unfortunate
for the glovers.

275
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,497
<i>If a man charges</i>
<i>no interest on a loan,</i>

276
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,666
<i>then he has nothing to gain</i>
<i>and everything to lose,</i>

277
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,168
<i>so why chance it?</i>

278
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,919
<i>Whereas the promise</i>
<i>of reward</i>

279
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:33,505
<i>makes a man</i>
<i>willing to gamble.</i>

280
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:37,009
We are not gamblers
here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

281
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:39,428
You are the world's
best gamblers.

282
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,315
And all those bets
you won built this.

283
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:55,911
We should celebrate.

284
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:58,447
I'm afraid I still have
a good deal of work to do.

285
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:00,582
<i>Oh, nonsense. Work's over.</i>
<i>Do you sing?</i>

286
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,334
- I don't have that gift.
- Oh, it's not a gift.

287
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:03,535
It's a skill.
Anyone can learn it.

This is the place, lads.

298
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:37,569
The sleekest little minks

- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

But I never was good

301

Sell your fish

302

Oh, let her in, Brusco.
I'm hungry.

303
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,769
Come here, sweetness.

304
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:17,743
They say oysters
get the juices flowing.

305
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,995
We'll take
half a dozen.

306
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,665
Three coppers.

Here's a silver

308

Brea.

<i>I have just the one.</i>

<i>But well worth it,</i>
<i>I assure you.</i>

00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,688
Too old.

315
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,365
Do you have
what I want or not?

316
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:50,252
Of course.
Of course.

317
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:57,709
These fresh?

318
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:04,299
Come on,
the lads are hungry.

319
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:12,107
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

320
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:14,192
<i>- Here. Thank you.</i>
<i>- I'll have one.</i>

321
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,229
<i>Any vinegar?</i>

322
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:20,532
Who let this girl in?
Shoo! Shoo!

323
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:43,055
Good.

324
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,232
I'll tell you
when we're done.

325
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:01,940
You'll have a fresh one
for me tomorrow?

326
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:04,276
Of course.

327
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:10,499
<i>I'll have you</i>
<i>whipped, girl.</i>

328
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:12,918
Go, go on.
Out, out, go.

329
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,681
Valar morghulis.

330
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,767
Valar morghulis.

331
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,617
And?

332
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:48,370
The thin man
wasn't hungry today.

333
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,489
Perhaps that is why
a man is thin.

334
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,290
Tomorrow.

335
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:55,494
- Tomorrow.

336
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:58,580
A girl has work to do.

337
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:15,430
Your rebellion is over.

338
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:18,266
You can swear
your allegiance to me now...

339
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,686
or you can die.

340
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:59,141
I believe
in second chances.

341
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:03,862
I don't believe
in third chances.

342
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,259
You write like
a seven-year-old.

343
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:38,096
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

344
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:39,598
<i>He didn't try</i>
<i>to make you pay?</i>

345
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,349
Mm-mmm.

346
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:43,518
Maybe he's changed.

347
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,821
The queen will be thrilled
to know you're bringing her daughter home.

348
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:48,106
She will.

349
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:50,609
You love her very much,
don't you?

350
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:53,111
Of course,
she's my niece.

351
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:55,080
I wasn't talking
about her.

352
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,084
You think I disapprove?

353
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,752
Why?

354
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:03,788
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

355
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,958
They disapproved of Oberyn
and me where you are from.

356
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,712
Here no one
blinked an eye.

357
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:13,215
100 years ago,

358
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:15,967
no one would have
blinked an eye at you

359
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,769
if you'd been named
Targaryen.

360
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,725
It's always changing, who we're
supposed to love and who we're not.

361
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:27,112
The only thing
that stays the same

362
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,981
is that we want
who we want.

363
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,077
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

364
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,246
that happened
to the man I love.

365
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,417
Perhaps even you
are innocent of that.

366
00:30:07,854 --> 00:30:09,854
Father.

367
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:14,659
Aren't you cold?

368
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:19,080
No.
What are you reading?

369
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:22,701
- "The Dance of Dragons."
- What's it about?

370
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:25,203
It's the story of the fight between
Rhaenyra Targaryen

371
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:28,540
and her half-brother
Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms.

372
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,376
Both of them thought
they belonged on the Iron Throne.

373
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:34,713
When people started
declaring for one of them or the other,

374
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,965
their fight divided
the kingdoms in two.

375
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,385
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

376
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:46,057
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

377
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,060
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

378
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:51,813
They never truly recovered.

379
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:53,865
"The Dance of Dragons."

380
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,652
Why is that a dance?

381
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,154
It's just what
they call it.

382
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:01,406
Hmm, doesn't make
much sense.

383
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,375
I think it's poetic.

384
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:12,751
If you had to choose

385
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:16,137
between Rhaenyra
and Aegon...

386
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:19,224
who would you
have chosen?

387
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,810
I wouldn't have
chosen either.

388
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:25,013
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

389
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:27,349
Sometimes a person
has to choose.

390
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:32,687
Sometimes the world
forces his hand.

391
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,575
If a man knows
what he is...

392
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:41,780
and remains true
to himself...

393
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:47,452
the choice
is no choice at all.

394
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:50,588
He must fulfill
his destiny...

395
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:56,261
and become
who he is meant to be.

396
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:00,799
However much
he may hate it.

397
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,969
It's all right, Father.

398
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:07,806
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

399
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:09,641
It doesn't matter.

400
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:11,893
I want to help you.

401
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,611
Is there any way
I can help?

402
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:22,871
Yes, there is.

403
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,739
Good. I want to.

404
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,794
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

405
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,080
And I'm your daughter.

406
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,313
Forgive me.

407
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:31,806
Where's my father?
I want to see my father.

408
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:34,976
It will all be over
soon, Princess.

409
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:40,398
No.

410
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,236
Where's my father?

411
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,739
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

412
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,241
<i>Please, let me</i>
<i>see my father.</i>

413
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:53,127
<i>Father, where are you?</i>
<i>Don't let her do this.</i>

414
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,831
Please let go!

415
00:33:56,883 --> 00:34:00,168
<i>Let me see my father!</i>
<i>Where are you? Please!</i>

416
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,287
- It's what the Lord wants.
- No.

417
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,340
-<i> Please! Let go! No!</i>
- It's a good thing.

418
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,509
- A great thing.
<i>-  Stop. Stop!</i>

419
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,210
<i>- Please!</i>
<i>- Hear us now, my Lord.</i>

420
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:11,162
<i> You can't do this!</i>

421
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:12,545
<i> For you, we offer up this girl</i>

422
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:13,408
Please!

423
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,396
<i> ...that you may cleanse</i>
<i>her with your fire</i>

424
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,347
and that its light
may lead our way.

425
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:19,431
<i> Please!</i>
<i>No, please let me see my father.</i>

426
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,600
If we don't act,
we'll all starve here.

427
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:23,602
- <i> All of us.</i>

428
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,320
But if we make
this sacrifice...

429
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,573
<i>Accept this token</i>
<i>of our faith, my Lord,</i>

430
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:30,442
and lead us
from the darkness.

431
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:33,445
- Lord of Light, show us the way.
- Mother!

432
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,614
Mother, please!

433
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:39,117
Mother, please!
Mother!

434
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,203
-<i> Mother!</i>
- We can't.

435
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:41,943
There's no other way.

436
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:43,289
- She has king's blood.
- <i> Please don't do this!</i>

437
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,290
<i>Lord of Light,</i>
<i>protect us.</i>

438
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:46,547
Please! Father, please!

439
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:48,572
<i>For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

440
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,963
Father!

441
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:53,015
Father, don't do this!
Please!

442
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,435
Mother, no! Please!
Please, help!

443
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,804
Don't do this!

444
00:34:58,856 --> 00:35:01,473
Please, Father!
Mother, help!

445
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:02,683
No.

446
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:04,707
<i> No, please!</i>
<i>Don't do this!</i>

447
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:08,196
<i>Don't do this,</i>
<i>please, Mother!</i>

448
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:12,117
<i>Please, Mother!</i>
<i>Mother, help!</i>

449
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,153
Mother, help!
Help!

450
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,322
<i>Please don't</i>
<i>do this, Mother!</i>

451
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:18,824
<i>Please!</i>

452
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,043
<i>Please, Mother!</i>
<i>Please!</i>

453
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,161
<i>Please! No!</i>

454
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:27,049
<i>Please! No!</i>

455
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,185
No!

456
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,370
Where have you been?

457
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,539
Just making sure
everything is in order.

458
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:13,799
They're waiting for you.

459
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,801
Clap your hands.

460
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,865
That one,
the smaller man.

461
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,667
No question, that's where you
should put your money.

462
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,085
The smaller man it is.

463
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,003
I'm not putting
my money anywhere.

464
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,206
Kings and queens
never bet on the games.

465
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,508
Perhaps you should go
find someone who does.

466
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,461
People used to bet against me when
I fought in the pits.

467
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:02,547
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

468
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,599
I've spent much
of my life in this arena.

469
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,635
And in my experience,
large men do triumph

470
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,970
over smaller men
far more often than not.

471
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,890
Has your experience
ever involved any actual fighting?

472
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,558
You yourself?

473
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,528
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

474
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,449
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

475
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:24,152
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

476
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:27,489
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

477
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,741
They couldn't get their
money out fast enough.

478
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:33,245
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

479
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:36,631
or... here.

480
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,416
And the big men
were always too slow

481
00:39:38,468 --> 00:39:41,303
to stop my dagger from going
where their muscles weren't.

482
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:45,173
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
standing across from me

483
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:49,311
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

484
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:03,158
You don't approve?

485
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:06,111
There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

486
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:08,113
I can do without it
in my leisure time.

487
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,582
Fair enough.
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

488
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:15,003
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

489
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:18,340
It's easy to confuse what is
with what ought to be,

490
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,126
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

491
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:22,677
I'm not talking
about myself.

492
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,347
I'm talking about
the necessary conditions for greatness.

493
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,299
That is greatness?

494
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:31,303
That is a vital part
of the great city of Meereen,

495
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:33,805
which existed
long before you or I

496
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:37,893
and will remain standing
long after we have returned to the dirt.

497
00:40:37,945 --> 00:40:39,978
My father
would have liked you.

498
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,576
One day your great city
will return to the dirt as well.

499
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:56,878
- At your command?
- If need be.

500
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:05,242
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

501
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,890
If it comes to that, they will have died
for a good reason.

502
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,009
Those men think they're
dying for a good reason.

503
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:12,844
Someone else's reason.

504
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,180
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

505
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:18,099
They don't know their own minds,
but you do?

506
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:21,152
Well said.
You're an eloquent man.

507
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,854
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

508
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:25,073
In my experience,
eloquent men are right

509
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,858
every bit as often
as imbeciles.

510
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:56,805
- Your Grace--
- Shut your mouth.

511
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:25,370
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

512
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:27,956
You can.

513
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:08,022
Protect your queen!

514
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,318
Go!

515
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,427
Your Grace!
Your Grace!

516
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,713
<i>Come with me.</i>
<i>I know a way out.</i>

517
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:49,147
I know a way--

518
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,100
Stay close.

519
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:35,059
This way.

520
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:47,622
The other side.

521
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,824
- Follow me.

522
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,245
Protect your queen!

523
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:49,887
Drogon!

524
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:54,151
