00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,959
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that--

6
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:52,261
We've been here
since midday.

7
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:04,374
Easterners have a difference sense
of time, I've often found.

8
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:08,411
Once I was waiting
for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.

9
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,080
Together, we were
going to run

10
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,616
three shiploads
of the finest--

11
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:43,012
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

12
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,315
Please, sit.

13
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:11,407
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

14
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,409
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

15
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,678
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

16
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,648
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

17
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,854
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

18
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,756
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

19
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,291
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

20
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:31,227
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

21
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,930
He shares no blood
with me.

22
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,366
He is a bastard
born of incest.

23
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,435
<i>As was his brother</i>
<i>before him.</i>

24
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,238
Yes, we have heard
this story.

25
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,907
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

26
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,277
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

27
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,713
A story about
a jealous uncle

28
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,949
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

29
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:57,920
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

30
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,655
Gold you loaned him.

31
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,893
And you feel your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

32
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:06,562
More than any man living.

33
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,499
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

34
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,668
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

35
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:15,204
and "blood right."

36
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:18,374
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

37
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,610
We prefer the stories
they tell.

38
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,545
More plain.

39
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,015
Less open
to interpretation.

40
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,154
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

41
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:32,555
4,000.

42
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,557
<i>And how many ships</i>
<i>do you have?</i>

43
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,826
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

44
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:39,328
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

45
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,732
32.

46
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,500
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

47
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,869
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

48
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:51,674
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

49
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,678
None.

50
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,548
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

51
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:01,717
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

52
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,488
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>we must respectfully</i>

53
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:08,591
<i>decline your request.</i>

54
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,727
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

55
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,938
My lord.

56
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,674
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

57
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,843
You would not be
either here.

58
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,778
In Braavos,

59
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,048
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

60
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,616
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

61
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,218
That would be the pirates.

62
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:38,654
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

63
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:42,191
This is the payment
that was demanded

64
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,526
by King Stannis
for my crimes.

65
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,962
I consider it
an honest accounting.

66
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,464
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

67
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:50,933
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

68
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:53,736
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

69
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,104
The war is over.

70
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,607
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

71
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,609
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

72
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,777
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

73
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:05,414
- <i>Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

74
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,186
67.

75
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,382
67. And when he dies,
who's in command?

76
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,987
A half-grown boy,

77
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,289
<i>the product of incest?</i>

78
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:16,125
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

79
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,828
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

80
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,963
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

81
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:24,634
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

82
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:27,303
That is a problem
for another time.

83
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,572
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

84
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:33,743
There's only one reliable leader
left in Westeros.

85
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,578
Stannis.

86
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,480
He's got the birthright.

87
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,649
He's in his prime.

88
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,384
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

89
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,653
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

90
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,021
he does it.

91
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:52,128
<i>The lookout sees a pirate ship</i>
<i>sailing their way.</i>

92
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,163
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

93
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:56,032
"Bring me
my red shirt."

94
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:59,035
The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

95
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,970
And when the pirates
try to board,

96
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:03,372
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

97
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,776
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

98
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,611
"Two pirate ships!"

99
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:12,448
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

100
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:14,450
But the courageous
captain hollers,

101
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,285
"Bring me
my red shirt!"

102
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,554
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

103
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:22,425
"Captain, why do you
call for your red shirt before battle?"

104
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,026
The captain replies,

105
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:27,863
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

106
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,099
The next morning
the lookout screams,

107
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,601
"10 pirate ships!

108
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:35,438
We are surrounded!"

109
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:37,239
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

110
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:39,775
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

111
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,911
<i>waiting for his</i>
<i>usual command.</i>

112
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:43,946
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

113
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,382
"Bring me my brown pants!"

114
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,655
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

115
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:56,125
Davos.

116
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,527
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon
in Dragonstone.

117
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:00,896
Only half rotted.

118
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,601
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

119
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,537
This is Lhara.

120
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,139
- And this is--
- I am Lhara.

121
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,845
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

122
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,248
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

123
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:20,683
We?

124
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,918
You, me-- we.

125
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:28,224
Once I thought
this man loved me.

126
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:32,395
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>he despises me.</i>

127
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:36,799
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold--

128
00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:48,411
You won't be alone.

129
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,979
And you won't be poor.

130
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,356
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

131
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,258
I gave it to your wife.

132
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,963
You're not my friend,
my friend.

133
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,567
I'll see you at sunrise.

134
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,839
"I give you until
the full moon

135
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:20,476
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

136
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,180
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks you call home.</i>

137
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:26,215
On the first night
of the full moon,

138
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:29,018
I will hunt down
every islander still on our lands

139
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:30,953
and flay them living,

140
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:33,656
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

141
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,257
I found
at Winterfell.

142
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:39,128
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

143
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,665
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

144
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:45,468
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

145
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,638
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

146
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,841
<i>with more Theon.</i>

147
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,876
<i>Signed Ramsay Snow,</i>

148
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,313
<i>natural born son</i>
<i>of Roose Bolton,</i>

149
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,315
<i>Lord of the Dreadfort</i>

150
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:02,284
<i>and Warden of the North."</i>

151
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:04,286
Yes!

152
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:06,455
<i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

153
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,258
<i>and they mutilated</i>
<i>my brother,</i>

154
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,627
<i>your prince.</i>

155
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,729
<i>Your prince.</i>

156
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:16,499
<i>Everything</i>
<i>they've done to him,</i>

157
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,601
<i>they've also</i>
<i>done to you.</i>

158
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,069
Yes! Yes!

159
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:24,006
<i>As long as they can hurt</i>
<i>our prince with impunity,</i>

160
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,043
<i>the word ironborn</i>
<i>means nothing.</i>

161
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,903
Go left.

162
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:05,047
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know--

163
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,415
I'm here
for Theon Greyjoy.

164
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:07,783
Take me to the dungeons.

165
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,052
He's not in the dungeons.

166
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:36,579
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

167
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:41,083
<i>This way!</i>

168
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:56,465
We're going home.

169
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,202
No!

170
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:06,375
It's all right.
It's me, Yara.

171
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,544
You can't trick me.

172
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,746
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

173
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,581
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

174
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:13,983
Not Theon! Reek!

175
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,751
- Reek! My name is Reek!
<i>- They're here.</i>

176
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,253
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

177
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:18,954
Help me with him.

178
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,856
No, you can't!

179
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,658
- You can't!
- You're Theon Greyjoy.

180
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:26,829
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

181
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:30,132
I'm Reek! Reek!
Loyal Reek!

182
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,968
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

183
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:46,315
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

184
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,166
<i>I'm Reek!</i>

185
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,135
Loyal Reek!

186
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:15,544
Aah!
Theon!

187
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:32,027
Give me my brother
and no more of your men will die.

188
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:35,064
You've got bigger balls
than he ever did.

189
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,836
But with those big balls
of yours...

190
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,976
how fast can you run?

191
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:53,015
<i>cage rattling )</i>

192
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,423
Make for the ship, now.

193
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,158
But your brother.

194
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,160
My brother is dead.

195
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:15,604
I have a treat for you.

196
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,339
A reward.

197
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,908
Reward?

198
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:22,211
Yes, Reek.

199
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,147
Those creatures
who came in the night,

200
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:27,816
they wanted
to take you away.

201
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,785
And you didn't let them.

202
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,221
You remained loyal.

203
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:36,158
I-- I didn't want
them to take me.

204
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:38,927
I was so scared.

205
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:41,263
- I didn't want them--
- Yes, yes, Reek.

206
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:52,474
It's a bath.

207
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,877
For you.

208
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:00,582
Remove those rags.

209
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,619
Now.

210
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,237
The britches, too, Reek.

211
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,872
Take them off.

212
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:52,794
Do you love me, Reek?

213
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:01,270
Yes, of course, my lord.

214
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,540
Good.

215
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:06,909
Because I need you
to do something for me.

216
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:09,011
Something very important.

217
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:12,314
There's a castle, you see.

218
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:15,417
Some bad men
hold this castle.

219
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:19,655
I need your help
to take this castle back.

220
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:24,927
But how can--

221
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:29,464
I need you to play a role.

222
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:33,569
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

223
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,308
Pretend to be who?

224
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:42,144
Theon Greyjoy.

225
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,983
goats bleating )

226
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:29,985
He is a goatherd.

227
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,555
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

228
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,191
I thank him
for his prayers.

229
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,642
It was your dragons,
he says.

230
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:57,245
<i>They came this morning</i>
<i>for his flock.</i>

231
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:03,351
He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

232
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,020
but now he has nothing.

233
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:08,256
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

234
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,094
<i>I cannot bring back his goats,</i>

235
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:16,965
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

236
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:35,550
Send the next one in.

237
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,186
Queen Daenerys.

238
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,288
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

239
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:15,357
I thank you.

240
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:18,393
Mine is one of the oldest and
proudest families in Meereen.

241
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:21,062
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

242
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:24,032
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

243
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:27,035
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

244
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:29,371
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

245
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:30,939
This pyramid included.

246
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,141
For that,
he has my gratitude.

247
00:22:33,176 --> 00:22:34,843
I should be honored
to meet him.

248
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:36,311
You have, Your Grace.

249
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:38,146
You crucified him.

250
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:42,450
I pray you'll
never live to see

251
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:44,452
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

252
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:47,989
Your father crucified
innocent children.

253
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:51,493
My father spoke out
against crucifying those children.

254
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:54,729
He decried it as a criminal act,
but was overruled.

255
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:58,099
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

256
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,569
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

257
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:03,972
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

258
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,775
You'd be wise
to remember that.

259
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:09,744
What's done is done.

260
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:12,914
You are the queen
and I am a servant of Meereen.

261
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:16,618
A servant who does not wish
to see its traditions eradicated.

262
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:19,454
And what traditions
do you speak of?

263
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,489
<i>The tradition</i>
<i>of funeral rite.</i>

264
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:23,825
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

265
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,396
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

266
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:30,765
are still nailed
to those posts,

267
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,969
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

268
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,047
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

269
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:48,283
so that they might receive
proper burials.

270
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:52,487
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

271
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:54,990
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

272
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:58,693
<i>Would you have begged</i>
<i>me for their right to a proper burial?</i>

273
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,429
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

274
00:24:01,497 --> 00:24:05,400
I can only speak to you as a son
who loved his father.

275
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,669
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

276
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:10,572
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

277
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:12,107
and buried with dignity

278
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,509
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

279
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,416
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

280
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:28,423
Thank you, my queen.

281
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,403
How many more?

282
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:44,706
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

283
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:47,542
212?

284
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,519
Send the next one in.

285
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:02,157
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

286
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:05,293
I was up late last night.

287
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:09,331
So, does this mean
I am a master of something now?

288
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,232
Coins, ships?

289
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,501
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

290
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:16,771
that I shall be the Master of Ships
long before you--

291
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,778
Lord Tywin,
it's a great honor

292
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,247
to have been granted a seat on
this council. I--

293
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:28,283
<i>The trial begins</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

294
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,485
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

295
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,987
Shall we begin?

296
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:34,022
Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

297
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:36,858
in the Riverlands,
my lord.

298
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:38,226
A coward and a traitor.

299
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,530
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

300
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:45,266
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

301
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,068
Disgraceful.

302
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,937
<i>What would it take to make</i>
<i>the common soldier</i>

303
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:51,239
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

304
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:53,842
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

305
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:56,711
Make it 100.
What else?

306
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:59,314
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

307
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:00,882
The Targaryen girl?

308
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,718
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

309
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:07,355
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

310
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,957
Conquered with what?

311
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,925
<i>She commands an army</i>
<i>of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

312
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,961
Some 8,000 strong.

313
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:15,296
She has a company
of sellswords--

314
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:16,698
the Second Sons.

315
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:19,134
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her--</i>

316
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:22,437
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

317
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:24,506
And she has
three dragons.

318
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,940
Baby dragons.

319
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,109
Larger every year,
Your Grace.

320
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:31,613
Mormont is spying
on her for us.

321
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,616
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

322
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,652
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

323
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:40,321
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

324
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:42,157
a bit harder
than anticipated.

325
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,092
He's an old man.

326
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:46,027
He wasn't fit
to protect my son.

327
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,096
Joffrey didn't die
on his watch.

328
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,433
Dismissing him was as insulting
as it was stupid.

329
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,569
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

330
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:58,173
A child with two
seasoned warriors counseling her

331
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:01,443
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

332
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,511
Lord Varys is right.

333
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:06,047
I have been to Essos
and seen the Unsullied firsthand.

334
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,584
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

335
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,352
Less so in the bedroom.

336
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:14,155
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

337
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,724
Armies win them
all the time.

338
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,993
She must be dealt with.

339
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,062
How, my lord?

340
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,430
By force?

341
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:24,499
Eventually,
if it comes to that.

342
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:29,604
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

343
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,639
Most certainly,
my Lord Hand.

344
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:34,609
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

345
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:36,377
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

346
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,434
Prince Oberyn.

347
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:01,870
Lord Varys...

348
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:05,106
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

349
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,675
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

350
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,544
And yet everyone does.

351
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:14,516
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

352
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,484
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

353
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:19,187
Five years.

354
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,822
May I ask why?

355
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:23,691
'Tis a big
and beautiful world.

356
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:26,394
Most of us live and die

357
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:28,129
in the same corner
where we were born

358
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,065
and never get to see
any of it.

359
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,701
I don't want to be
most of us.

360
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,737
Most of us
aren't princes.

361
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:40,608
You are from Essos.

362
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,478
Where? Lys?

363
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,514
<i>I have an ear</i>
<i>for accents.</i>

364
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,216
I've lost
my accent entirely.

365
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,751
I have an ear
for that as well.

366
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:53,821
<i>How did you get here?</i>

367
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:55,456
It's a long story.

368
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:58,459
One you don't like
telling people.

369
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:01,095
People I trust.

370
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,199
My paramour Ellaria,
she would find you very interesting.

371
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:06,534
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

372
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:09,604
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they serve here.

373
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:12,807
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

374
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:18,079
You did like boys before?

375
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,050
Really?

376
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,952
Girls? Hmm.

377
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:26,654
I hope you won't be offended when I say
I never would have guessed.

378
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,122
Not at all.

379
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,992
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

380
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:33,428
- What then?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

381
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:36,264
Everybody is interested
in something.

382
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:38,066
<i>Not me.</i>

383
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,301
When I see what
desire does to people,

384
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:42,270
what it's done
to this country,

385
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:45,139
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

386
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:49,611
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>the absence of desire</i>

387
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:52,747
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

388
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:54,449
Such as?

389
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:32,654
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

390
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:50,738
Really?

391
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,741
Father's orders.

392
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:57,545
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

393
00:31:07,923 --> 00:31:09,924
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

394
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:59,040
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

395
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:00,808
<i>First of my Name,</i>

396
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:03,144
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

397
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:05,780
and Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms,

398
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:09,550
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

399
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:12,720
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

400
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:16,657
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

401
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,595
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

402
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:23,931
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

403
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:26,334
And if found guilty...

404
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:30,238
may the gods
punish the accused.

405
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,242
Tyrion of
the House Lannister,

406
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:12,380
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

407
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:16,050
Did you kill King Joffrey?

408
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,653
No.

409
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:21,022
Did your wife,
the Lady Sansa?

410
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:23,491
Not that I know of.

411
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:26,828
How would you say
he died, then?

412
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:29,030
Choked on his pigeon pie.

413
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:32,500
So you would
blame the bakers?

414
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,936
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

415
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:40,875
The crown may call
its first witness.

416
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:43,044
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

417
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:45,046
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

418
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,415
He slapped the king
across the face

419
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:49,917
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

420
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,688
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

421
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,623
Right here
in this throne room,

422
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:58,526
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

423
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,862
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

424
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,697
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

425
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:04,532
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

426
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:06,901
he threatened
to have me killed.

427
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:08,936
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

428
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:11,772
<i>- Silence.</i>
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

429
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,441
while you tore
at her clothes and beat her.

430
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:16,177
Silence!

431
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:20,114
You will not speak
unless called upon.

432
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,651
You're dismissed,
Ser Meryn.

433
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:32,760
Basilisk venom,

434
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:35,296
widow's blood,

435
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,565
wolfsbane,

436
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,800
essence of nightshade,

437
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,703
sweetsleep,

438
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:44,839
tears of Lys,

439
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:47,108
demon's dance...

440
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:50,845
blind eye--

441
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,080
I think you have
made your point, Grand Maester.

442
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:54,949
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

443
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:56,984
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

444
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:59,921
My stores were plundered.

445
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:01,255
By whom?

446
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,158
<i>By the accused,</i>
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

447
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:06,594
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

448
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:09,130
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

449
00:35:09,164 --> 00:35:12,166
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

450
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,504
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

451
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:19,073
Without question.

452
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,979
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

453
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:26,581
the king's fool.

454
00:35:26,615 --> 00:35:30,651
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

455
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:34,422
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

456
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:37,892
She wore this necklace

457
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:40,127
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

458
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:43,431
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

459
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:47,435
and terrible poison
was found inside.

460
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:51,439
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

461
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:54,542
It was.
The Strangler.

462
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:58,412
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

463
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:03,050
And used to strike down
the most noble child

464
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:05,886
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

465
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:16,097
<i>"I will hurt you for this.</i>

466
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:18,899
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

467
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:21,335
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

468
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,471
and you will know
the debt is paid."

469
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:27,108
Your own brother
said this to you?

470
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,278
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

471
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:35,549
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

472
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:39,820
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

473
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:42,156
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

474
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,093
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

475
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,196
Tyrion said,

476
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:51,899
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

477
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,201
What debt?

478
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:57,171
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

479
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:59,006
in the Tower of the Hand.

480
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,542
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

481
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:04,178
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

482
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:06,147
He wasn't pleased.

483
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:10,918
Thank you, Your Grace,

484
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:13,254
for the courage
of your testimony.

485
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:31,305
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the precise nature of this threat?</i>

486
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:33,908
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

487
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:37,845
<i>He said, "Perhaps you should speak</i>
<i>more softly to me, then.</i>

488
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,780
Monsters are dangerous

489
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,249
and just now kings
are dying like flies."

490
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:45,586
And he said this to you at a meeting
of the small council?

491
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,854
Yes.

492
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:49,990
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

493
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:52,293
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

494
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:54,795
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

495
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,264
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

496
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:03,738
You're excused,
Lord Varys.

497
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,809
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

498
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,584
One.

499
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,689
You once said

500
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:25,459
that without me, this city would have
faced certain defeat.

501
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:29,063
You said the histories
would never mention me,

502
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:31,766
but you would not forget.

503
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:35,703
Have you forgotten,
Lord Varys?

504
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:40,341
Sadly, my lord,

505
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,110
I never forget a thing.

506
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,222
We will adjourn for now.

507
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,193
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

508
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,395
<i>Clear the court!</i>

509
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,851
<i>You'd condemn</i>
<i>your own son to death?</i>

510
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:26,053
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

511
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:27,588
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

512
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:29,924
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

513
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,392
I know nothing
of the sort.

514
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:33,928
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

515
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,796
As did I.

516
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,399
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

517
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:41,302
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

518
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,804
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

519
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,607
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

520
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:49,810
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

521
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,913
If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be
punished accordingly.

522
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:55,516
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

523
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:01,121
Once you said family
is what lives on.

524
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:03,157
All that lives on.

525
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:06,694
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

526
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,597
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

527
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:12,499
I'm a Kingsguard,

528
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,435
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

529
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,170
I'm well aware
of your oath.

530
00:40:16,204 --> 00:40:18,305
What happens to your name?

531
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,709
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

532
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,711
Your nephews?

533
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:25,312
Lancel Lannister?

534
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,581
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

535
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,283
What happens to my dynasty

536
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:31,552
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

537
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:34,154
It survives through me.

538
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,525
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

539
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,362
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

540
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:44,265
if you let Tyrion live.

541
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:45,766
Done.

542
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:50,871
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

543
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,640
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

544
00:40:52,674 --> 00:40:56,677
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him
to join the Night's Watch.

545
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:01,248
<i>In three days' time,</i>
<i>he'll depart for Castle Black</i>

546
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:02,950
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

547
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:05,552
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

548
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:07,554
<i>You will leave</i>
<i>King's Landing</i>

549
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:09,790
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

550
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:12,259
You will marry
a suitable woman

551
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:15,329
and father children
named Lannister.

552
00:41:15,363 --> 00:41:19,266
And you'll never turn your back on
your family again.

553
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:25,873
You have my word.

554
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:27,708
And you have mine.

555
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,968
Not going well,
is it?

556
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:56,470
- You're going to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

557
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:59,273
When you are, you need to enter
a formal plea for mercy

558
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,542
and ask to be sent
to the Wall.

559
00:42:01,576 --> 00:42:03,544
Father's agreed to it.

560
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:06,313
He'll spare your life and allow you
to join the Night's Watch.

561
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:08,983
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

562
00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:10,985
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

563
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,920
<i>Father is not Joffrey.</i>
<i>He'll keep his word.</i>

564
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:14,755
How do you know?

565
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,494
Do you trust me?

566
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:26,033
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

567
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:28,102
This will all be over soon.

568
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,954
The crown may call
its next witness.

569
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:23,457
State your name.

570
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:25,459
Shae.

571
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,694
Do you swear
by all the gods

572
00:43:27,729 --> 00:43:30,264
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

573
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:33,167
I swear it.

574
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,968
Do you know this man?

575
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:45,879
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

576
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,748
How do you know him?

577
00:43:47,782 --> 00:43:51,051
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

578
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:55,155
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

579
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,391
What do you know of this?

580
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:01,295
I know that he's guilty.

581
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,731
He and Sansa
planned it together.

582
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:08,502
<i>Silence!</i>

583
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:11,038
<i>Continue.</i>

584
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:13,974
<i>She wanted revenge</i>
<i>for her father,</i>

585
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:15,509
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

586
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:18,312
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

587
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:20,747
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

588
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:24,418
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

589
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:27,488
He hated you, my lord.

590
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:30,691
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

591
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:32,559
to put in Joffrey's wine.

592
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:35,129
<i>How could you possibly</i>
<i>know all this?</i>

593
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:38,966
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

594
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:43,003
I wasn't just her maid.

595
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:47,474
I was his whore.

596
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:50,477
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

597
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:52,179
You said you were his...

598
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:54,047
His whore.

599
00:44:56,918 --> 00:44:59,386
How did you come
to be in his service?

600
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,721
He stole me.

601
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:02,256
I was with another man,

602
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,824
a knight in
your lordship's army.

603
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:06,393
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

604
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:08,629
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

605
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:13,167
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

606
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:15,702
"You belong to me now,"
he said.

607
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:19,673
"I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world."

608
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:25,145
Silence.
Silence!

609
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:28,081
And did you?

610
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,617
Did I what?

611
00:45:30,652 --> 00:45:33,320
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

612
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:37,824
I did everything
he wanted.

613
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,027
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

614
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:41,995
Whatever he felt
like doing to me.

615
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,231
<i>I kissed him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

616
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:45,799
<i>I licked him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

617
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,902
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

618
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:50,837
I was his property.

619
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:53,106
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

620
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,975
so he could use me
when he was bored.

621
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:58,946
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

622
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,649
I took his face
in my hands and said,

623
00:46:02,684 --> 00:46:05,719
"I am yours
and you are mine."

624
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:10,991
Shae.

625
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:16,263
Please don't.

626
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:20,801
I am a whore.

627
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:23,403
<i>Remember?</i>

628
00:46:25,373 --> 00:46:27,407
That was before
he married Sansa.

629
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:30,077
After that,
all he wanted was her.

630
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:32,679
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

631
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:36,917
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

632
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,128
Father,

633
00:46:48,162 --> 00:46:50,764
I wish to confess.

634
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,302
I wish...
to confess.

635
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:59,940
You wish to confess?

636
00:47:01,843 --> 00:47:03,477
I saved you.

637
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:07,514
I saved this city

638
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:11,051
and all your
worthless lives.

639
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:14,588
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

640
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:17,257
Tyrion.

641
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:22,629
Do you wish to confess?

642
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,735
Yes, Father.

643
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,271
I'm guilty.

644
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,274
Guilty. Is that what you
want to hear?

645
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,410
You admit you poisoned
the king?

646
00:47:36,444 --> 00:47:39,012
No, of that
I'm innocent.

647
00:47:39,047 --> 00:47:43,050
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

648
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:46,553
I am guilty
of being a dwarf.

649
00:47:47,722 --> 00:47:50,157
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

650
00:47:50,191 --> 00:47:52,392
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

651
00:47:52,427 --> 00:47:56,663
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

652
00:47:57,865 --> 00:47:59,566
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

653
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,001
<i>Nothing but this--</i>

654
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:03,970
I did not do it.

655
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:06,940
I did not kill Joffrey,

656
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,276
but I wish that I had.

657
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,179
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

658
00:48:12,213 --> 00:48:16,283
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

659
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:23,657
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

660
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:28,628
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

661
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:30,831
I would gladly
give my life

662
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:33,166
to watch you all
swallow it.

663
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,235
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.

664
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:37,904
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

665
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,810
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

666
00:48:43,845 --> 00:48:47,080
<i>And I know I'll get</i>
<i>no justice here.</i>

667
00:48:47,115 --> 00:48:50,384
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

668
00:48:51,786 --> 00:48:55,255
I demand a trial
by combat.
